Our project seeks to build a website where a user can explore different tennis players’ statistics, player details, etc. 
through a different player card for each athlete. We will have one page containing all the information 
of the players, and another page that enables users to “mock” a game with the two players of 
choice. To achieve the mocking page, a prediction model that will simulate a game between two 
players based on their statistics. Users can also pick the tennis surface in which the players will
be competing in this “mocked game.”

Right now, we just have our database and queries, but we will later oroganize our repo in client-facing, 
and server-facing directories.
